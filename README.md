**How do you run it?**

First, create `index.html` by `cd`ing to `client`
Run `elm make src/Index.elm`, this should create the index.html. Open this on your browser
`cd` back to where the `.cabal` file is (i.e., `cd ..`) and do `cabal run`. This should have the server running, and you'll get some output on your terminal
Read `Report.pdf` to see some example inputs and off you go!
