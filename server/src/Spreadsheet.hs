-- here is what I'm imagining:
-- you open a sheet, and you see a bunch of individual cells. Before you can put any 
-- values in it you need to section of "tables". Then you can define transformations (flows) 
-- from one table ot other tables. Maybe this is overcomplicated but I think its slightly 
-- more structured and perhaps a bit nicer. 
-- How the hell you implement that, however, remains to be seen.
